### Rudi Ausbuddel Simulator (Remastered) 


One upon a time, a game on the now dead haterhub has attracted the attention of the industry. This masterpiece, known as "Rudi Ausbuddel Simulator" is now nowhere to find.

The plot of the game revolved around the deceased "Rudi" who has to be dug up from his grave in order to prevent the apocalypse or something. The game wasn't exactly clear on that.
